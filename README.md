# Wakfu V2

- To set your hotkeys, go into config.py and replace my hotkeys with whatever you want. Keep the single quotes.
- You can also add hotkeys if you needed it for whatever reason. Just keep syntax correct.
- Keep in mind that whatever hotkeys you set will not be able to be used in Wakfu. I blocked those keys from being sent to Wakfu to help make sure Ankama can not see anything remotely considered suspicious.

#V2 Update
- Added GUI and now you utilize 1 single hotkey to Cycle through window list!
