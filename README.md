# Wakfu V2

- To set your hotkey, go into config.py and replace cycle_key with whatever you want. Keep the single quotes.
- Keep in mind that whatever hotkey you set will not be able to be used in Wakfu. I blocked the hotkey from being sent to Wakfu for peace of mind.


#V2 Update
- Added GUI and now you utilize 1 single hotkey to Cycle through window list!
